## Problems:

### Problem 1:
Assume that the following relationship is valid:
$$
Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + \epsilon_i
$$
where $\mathbb{E}\left[\epsilon_i\right] = 0$ and $\mathbb{E}\left[\epsilon_i^2\right] = \sigma^2$.  Use the definition of the variance of a random variable to derive the variance of $Y_i$.

### Problem 2:

Which of the following equations linear in the parameters $\beta_j$, or can be transformed into such an equation?  Explain.
<ol> 
  <li>$Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i^\frac{3}{2} +\epsilon_i$;</li>
  <li>$Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 * \beta_2 * \beta_3 X_i + \epsilon_i$;</li>
  <li>$Y_i = \beta_0 X_i^{\beta_1} \epsilon_i$.</li>
</ol>
