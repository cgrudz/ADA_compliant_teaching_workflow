## Help & Questions

Students can see the instructor without appointment during office hours.  Outside of office hours, the best way to contact the instructor is via email.  Emails received before 16:00 will usually get a response the same day.  Emails received after 16:00 are not guaranteed a same-day response.  Longer questions will not be answered by email and will be directed to appointments or office hours.


## Course description

This course covers techniques and applications of regression analysis, including inference and model diagnostics.
The main goal is to empower learners to confidently perform and communicate a regression analysis of real data to
address research questions in a reproducible framework.

<div class="pagebreak"> </div>

## Prerequisites

Students will benefit from familiarity with statistical notions such as hypothesis testing and confidence intervals, as well as with calculus and matrix operations.  Advanced knowledge in the above subjects is not expected.  Students will also benefit from earlier programming experience.

## Recommended references

There is not a required text and students are required only to understand the material covered in class and assignments --- lecture slides and materials will be archived online for students to review. Students will benefit, however, from additional reading from sources where the lectures are based.  These are the following:

* *Faraway, Julian J. Linear models with R, Second Edition. Chapman and Hall/CRC, 2016.*
	*  [Free preprint version available in PDF from the CRAN Project](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Faraway-PRA.pdf)

## Assignments and grading

This will be a programming heavy class and it is expected that every student has access to a computer and the (free) statistical software [R](https://www.r-project.org) installed.  Students are not expected to already be proficient in programming.  Some class time and assignments will be used to practice these skills but it will be the responsibility of each student to learn enough programming to complete their assignments.  Students using R are strongly encouraged to use the
front-end [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com).  Class time may include lectures, quizzes, group-work problem solving and lab-sessions.  Students without a computer during class time will be asked to work with others to participate in the lab-sessions.


The assignment schedule is tentative, and will be subject to change.  The up-to-date schedule will always be updated on the [course web page](https://cgrudz.github.io/teaching/stat_757_2019_fall).


 * Class attendance is mandatory, and participation is essential for the course.  Attendance and participation grades will be evaluated on whether the student arrives to class on time, and if they participate in a warm-up quiz at the beginning of class.  This warm-up is graded on completion.
	
 * There will usually be __homework due on Thursdays at the beginning of class__.  Homework will be assigned on a Thursday and will be due one week later.  Students are encouraged to work together on their homework assignments, but every student must turn in their own work and solutions.  Solutions to the homework assignment will be posted on the course archive after the homework due date.  __Part or all of the homework assignment will be graded, but students are responsible to look over the provided solutions to make sure they understand the material__.
 * There will be __one in-class midterm__ which covers the introductory part of the course --- this is tentatively scheduled for 09/26.  Students are allowed one $8.5 \times 11$ inch page of handwritten notes for the midterm, but the exam must be completed individually.  Communication between a student and anyone except the instructor during exam time will be considered cheating.  
 * There will be __one take-home midterm project__.  This will be assigned on 10/17 and will be __due two weeks later on Thursday 10/31__.  This project will be open book, open notes, open computer (including internet resources).  This will take the form of an initial investigation and proposal for the final modeling project. Students may work with others on their project, but each student must submit their own work and individual report.
  * There will be a __final modeling project__ including a written report and presentation.  This project will be open book, open notes, open computer (including internet resources).  Students may work with others on their project, but each student must submit their own work and individual report.  The final project report will be due at the time of the __class final, 9:50 - 11:50, Tuesday 12/17/2019__.  All students will make a 5 minute presentation, summarizing their project and results.  This presentation will be delivered to the whole class during the scheduled class final.

## Final grades

Final grades will be calculated according to the scores from attendance, homework, midterms, and the project, each weighted as follows:  

<table class="minimalistBlack">
<thead>
<tr>
  <th>Category</th>
  <th>Percent of final grade</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tr>
  <td>Attendance and warm-ups</td>
  <td> $10\%$</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Homework assignments</td>
  <td>$10\%$ </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Midterm 1</td>
  <td> $25\%$ </td>
<tr>
  <td>Midterm 2</td>
  <td>$25\%$ </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Final project</td>
  <td>$30\%$</td> 
</tr>
</table>

The final letter grade will be assigned according to the weighted score as in the following table:

## Late policy and exceptions


There are no makeups for exams or homework except for university recognized activities or exceptional circumstances, as per university policy.  If a student needs to miss class due to participation in official university activities or a religious observance, they must make arrangements with the instructor at least one week prior to the date in question.  In cases of absences due to extended illness, family emergency, bereavement, or other compelling reason, students should notify the instructor as soon as possible and __within one week of the start of the absence__.  The instructor has the right to request formal, written documentation in such cases as they deem appropriate.  Please see the [full policy statement on absences](https://www.unr.edu/administrative-manual/3000-3999-students/3020-class-absence-policy).

In any other circumstance, there will not be makeups for exams or homework.  However, the lowest lowest homework score will be dropped for each student to accommodate unexpected circumstances.
