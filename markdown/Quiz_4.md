## Problems:

### Problem 1:

In this problem, we will only assume the following: 
$$n, p \geq 2 $$  
and let $\mathbf{X}\in \mathbb{R}^{n \times p}$.

Define $\mathbf{X}^\dagger = \left(\mathbf{X}^\mathrm{T} \mathbf{X}\right)^{-1} \mathbf{X}^\mathrm{T}$. Carefully compute the value of the product $\mathbf{X}^\dagger \mathbf{X}.$

### Problem 2:
Recall the definition of the $TSS$,
$$TSS \triangleq \sum_{i=1}^n \left(Y_i - \overline{Y}\right)^2, $$
such that the $TSS$ is a random variable, defined as a combination of the random variables $Y, \overline{Y}$. What is the value of the expectation of the $TSS$?
