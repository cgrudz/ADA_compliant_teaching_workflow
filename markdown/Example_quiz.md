## Problems:


### Problem 1:
In the figure below is a plot of the residuals versus the fitted values for some linear model.  Which of our usual assumptions may not hold, and what does this
imply for the linear model?  What test can we use to diagnose the issue?

![Image of residuals versus fitted values with non-constant variance in the residuals over cases.](hetero.png){width=40%}\

### Problem 2:

In the figure below is a plot of the residuals versus the fitted values for some linear model.  Which of our usual assumptions may not hold, and what does this
imply for the linear model?

![Image of residuals versus fitted values with nonlinear behavior in the residuals over cases.](nonlinear.png){width=40%}\
