## Problems:

In the following, we refer to the standard regression model,
$$Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + \epsilon_i,$$
for which we assume the conditions of the Gauss-Markov theorem hold.

### Problem 1:

Assume that $X = 0$ is within the scope of the model. What is the implication for the regression model if $\beta_0$ = 0 so that the model is
$$Y_i = \beta_1 X_i + \epsilon_i?$$

How would the regression function plot on a graph?

### Problem 2:

What is the implication for the regression model if $\beta_1 = 0$,
so that the model is 
$$Y_i = \beta_0 + \epsilon_i?$$
